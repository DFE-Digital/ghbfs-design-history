## What we changed
- Added a bold style to the whole message row to indicate when a message has not been viewed

## Why we changed this
Proc ops told us that they were finding it hard to know which messages needed attention.

## How it works
we looked at existing messaging services such as Gmail and Outlook to understand how they make it clear to a user that a message is new or unread.
