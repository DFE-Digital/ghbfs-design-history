## What we changed
- Used the full width of the column to make reading messages easier
- Split out messages based on the conversation threads with a list of all messages
- Collapsed larger conversations, making the most relevant message available to the user
- Bundled up larger conversations behind a button to prevent users being overwhelmed
- Added the ability to BCC and CC on existing and new message threads
- Updated the new message function, allowing message, to, bcc and cc to be editable

## Why we changed this
We have feedback from the proc ops team working within the CMS that message threads were very hard to read and manage.
The initial request from proc ops was to 'move the reply button to the top of the page'. After probing we were able to discover that threads were becoming far too long and unmanageable.

## How it works
Emails are synced directly from an Outlook inbox every 5-10 mins. We can split messages based on thread conversations and also understand which are the older messages, where does the info need collapsing.


## Further considerations
This is a large design change and we need to check with proc on how this is working for them.
We are tracking any issues and addressing fixes where possible.
