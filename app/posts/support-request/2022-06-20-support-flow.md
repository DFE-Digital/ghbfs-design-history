## What we changed
- We updated the flow to ask about users confidence in prorement
- We added a question around any special requirements for the user / technology they used.
- We are asking the user about their procurement value
- Users without a DfE signin can still access the service

## Why we changed this
We are using this as a starting point when referencing the support query flow.

## How it works
Users can signin or access support without a signin. We ask for details about their procurement, value and also about their confidence and special requirements. At the end of the support request the user will be given a case number, a templated email response and the case will be reviewed and triaged by the proc ops team. 

## Further considerations
We need to look at the triage process for proc ops and whether we need more info at this stage and if we can ask for less now and collect the required information another way.
