## What we changed

- Added a question around the users previous purchasing of the same goods / services
- Added a question around the users experience of using a framework to buy goods and services
- Updated the confidence question by focusing on framework experience and reducing the available responses

## Why we changed this

- We need to focus on the users experience of using a framework and whether their confidence changes over time.

## How it works

- By selecting yes to the framework use then we ask about the confidence of using a framework.
- If the user selects no to using a framework then they will skip the confidence question as they have no previous experience.

## Further considerations

- We are tracking confidence throughout the service using surveys and exit interviews.
