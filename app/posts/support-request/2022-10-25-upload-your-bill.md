## What we changed

- Added two new pages before the DfE signin to ask about energy and a bill
- Added ability to multi upload documents
- Added progress indicators and the ability to remove and add more files
- There are drop off pages to capture if a user doesnâ€™t have a bill

## Why we changed this

- We know that more energy cases are coming into proc ops due to the increase in costs.
- We know that the bill gives proc ops all the information they need to understand whether they can help the school
- We know that as part of the initial calls with schools that the bill is requested so we are speeding up that process if the request is about energy

## How it works

- The question around energy allows the user to view the upload bill flow.
- There are ways to drop out of the upload flow if the user does not have a bill with them or they need to do it in another way

## Further considerations

- By adding the energy question at the front of the service we are adding some category information
- We know that triaging is a huge problem for proc ops so we need to look at what else we can do to help proc ops sort cases into towers
