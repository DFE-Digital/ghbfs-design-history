## What we changed
- Added the notification component on the start page to point to the latest guidance
- Added a standalone page with the latest guidanace
- Added further guidance on the Energy bill relief scheme

## Why we changed this
We know that schools are worried about rising energy costs and more cases are coming to proc ops focusing on energy. We have been given guidance on what we can tell schools and we wanted to make sure this information is easy to find and that any schools wanting help with an energy contract will see the guidance in advance of changing their contract.

## How it works
The notification compoenent will direct users to a standalone page that contains the latest guidance. 
We are trying to reduce the number of places where the same content appears.

## Further considerations
We are working on the Find a framework page as well. Updates to the energy guidance are reflected in the Find a framework service as well
