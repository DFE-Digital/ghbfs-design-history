## What we changed
- Added a checkbox asking if the user needs support with choosing a framework
- Added the question is the user needs support with a specific framework

## Why we changed this
We know that schools struggle to use Find a Framework and that Proc Ops can give more up to date information and a tailored experience. If we can get schools to request support then we are confident that Proc Ops will be able to recommend the most suitable framework for the school.

## How it works
- We ask the question if they need support which takes the user to the support query.
- We will know what they need help with depending on which framework page they are on.
- We will know if they need help between choosing a framework or whether they need help with a specific framework.
- We will also know which category they are asking for support with.

## Further considerations
The matching frameworks page could be improved to change the framework options into radios. The assumption is that this will make the page more obvious to the user. By selecting a matching framework then can decide if they need help with a particular framework.
